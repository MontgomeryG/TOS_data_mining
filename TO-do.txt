We have all calls properly made. 
Now we need to save them as a variable that we call into the .vb... we don't want to have to deal with that 
headache of copy/pasting 11k+ rows.
So we save each element as a .txt.
Call .txt into .vb.
Put each element in the right place. (we will ensure it works before moving it to other computer)

Once running properly. We want to make an app.

App will allow users to pick a window of time.
Users select from a dropdown a stock in S&P or NQ they want to see.
We show them the 3 second interval data for that stock at that particular time. All columns.

Then we graph some of the columns. (price)...

Also, we should allow the user to choose which stock they want to use this program to gather independent variables.


Add clear instructions as to how to use this application, which tools are required to do so.
